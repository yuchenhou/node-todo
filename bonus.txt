# What I will do next

I will do a demo to Emeril(let him try it out if possible), find out what else
he wants the most(e.g. better performance, one more feature) and improve the
app accordingly.
2 of us can repeat the above process for a few iterations until we agree that
we have spent a reasonable amount of time building a good enough app for the task.

# Why I will do that

I do that to most efficiently handle this ambiguous phase. Our goal is very
clear: build this app for him to take orders in the food festival. But the
requirements are very unclear. I don't know what he really wants(he probably
doesn't know that either). Therefore, to avoid wasting time doing useless work,
I should build this app incrementally: during each iteration, do a small change
and get feedback immediately(he's my friend so he shouldn't mind providing
feedback frequently!).

# what I need to do only if there is long-term plan for the app

If the app needs long-term development/maintenance, I will need to do some
extra work to facilitate development: refactor the changes I made, add unit
tests, add functional tests, set up continuous integration and auto deployment.

# why I need to do that

Because these cost me time in the short run and save me time in the long run.
